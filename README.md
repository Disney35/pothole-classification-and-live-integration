üöÄ Project Overview

This project is designed to:

‚Ä¢ Classify roads as plain or containing potholes.

‚Ä¢ Detect potholes in images or live video using the YOLOv8 algorithm.

‚Ä¢ Automatically notify authorities by sending email alerts when potholes are detected.

‚Ä¢ Provide real-time visualization of potholes on video feeds.
